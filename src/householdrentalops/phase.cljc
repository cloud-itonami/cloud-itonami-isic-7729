(ns householdrentalops.phase
  "Phase gate for the community household-goods rent-to-own operations
  coordinator rollout (0->3 maturity). Mirrors `tobaccoops.phase`
  (cloud-itonami-isic-0115) in shape, adapted to this actor's op set
  (no separate request-level :stake -- the request's :op IS the stake,
  since every op this actor may propose is already coordination-only).

  Phase 0: simulation/test only -- NO proposal ever autonomously commits;
    even a Governor-clean proposal escalates for human review.
  Phase 1: supervised operation -- always-escalate ops
    (`householdrentalops.governor/always-escalate-ops`) escalate even
    when clean; other ops commit if the Governor approves.
  Phase 2: reduced supervision -- escalate only on Governor
    violation/low-confidence; routine ops commit.
  Phase 3: full autonomy -- the Governor's verdict is authoritative.

  See `operation.cljc` for how the phase gate is invoked."
